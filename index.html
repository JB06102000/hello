<p>A repository is a central place where data, files, or code are stored and managed. In software development, it's commonly used to store and track changes to code. Repositories can be hosted on platforms like GitHub or GitLab, allowing multiple people to collaborate on a project, manage versions, and keep a history of changes.</p>
